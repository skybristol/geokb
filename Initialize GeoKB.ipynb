    "This notebook is a work in progress process for initializing the Geoscience Knowledgebase with a set of properties and foundational semantics that establishes a base to build from in curating geoscientific knowledge. Our initial use cases have to do with integrating mineral occurrence information along with document references contributing to those and other facts and concepts associated with conducting mineral resource assessment. In order to build a useful knowledge graph on these concepts, though, we also need to tie in lots of other things needed for the claims associated with these things to legitimately link to other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we use NI \"43-101 Technical Reports\" and a newer \"SK-1300 Technical Report\" as sources for claims associated with mining projects/properties such as geographic location, mineral commodities identified and/or extracted, figures indicating estimates of ore grade and tonnage, and other details. These are technical geoscientific reports required by the Canadian and U.S. governments, respectively. We need an \"instance of\" (rdf:type) claim on everything like this in the system. While we could simply create items in the graph to represent these two classes with no further classification, it is useful to \"work back up the semantic hierarchy\" for as many concepts as we can as far as we need to in order for the information we are recording in the GeoKB to be understandable in the broader global knowledge commons (Wikidata and/or other efforts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization process here is designed to give us a semantic baseline to work from as we pull in the information and connections we really care about within this context. We're taking a pragmatic approach that is slightly more rigorous (and certainly more streamlined) than the wild west of Wikidata but somewhere short of endlessly academic. We have to get a whole bunch of information into the GeoKB to support analytical use, so we make a best effort to align what we have with mature ontologies and namespaces, knowing we'll have to evolve it over time. The notebook approach on this gives us a good basis to record our reasoning and the places we have to make pragmatic tradeoffs."

We will likely need to iterate on this several times to get it right, and we will doubtless miss some things.\n",
